### Hi, I'm Prashant Jaitly 👋

I am a **Financial Risk Analyst (FRM Level I Passed)** with 2+ years of experience in quantitative risk analytics, regulatory compliance, and data-driven analysis.

I specialize in bridging the gap between risk management and data science, using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** to build models, quantify risk, and deliver scannable, actionable insights for stakeholders.
